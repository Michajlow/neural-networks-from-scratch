# Neural networks architectures from scratch (numpy only)

<p align="justify">The objective was to implement few neural network classes from scratch using numpy only and solve some simple NLP tasks. For now the project includes implementation of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Feed-forward network</li>
  <li>Vanilla RNN</li>
  <li>LSTM</li>
  <li>Bidirectional LSTM</li>
  <li>Embedding layer</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">All neural network classes could be stacked togather to one model and could be used similar to popular libraries like Keras. The implementation was made <b>purely for my educational purposes, could be useful for someone with the same purposes and obviously is not as efficient as any of the popular libraries or frameworks like Keras or Tensorflow.</b> However, it can give a deeper :) understanding and hands-on experience with the neural network architectures.</p>

### Getting Started
<ul>
  <li>Download folder mylab to your working dir</li>
  <li>Import tools you will use (see examples) to your jupyther notebook or python script</li>
</ul>

### Prerequisites
<ul>
  <li>Numpy</li>
  <li>For some examples of use additional popular libraries might be required</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">The theoretical base was taken from variaty of books and online deeplearning courses, particularly from <a href = 'https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models/home/welcome'>COURSERA Sequence models</a>, which I highly recommend for everyone who would like to make first steps in deep learning, however <b>the code doesnt directly repeat any of course's assignments</b> and well-documented for the same active learners as me.</p>
